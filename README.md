# About
This repository will include my first steps into bare metal STM32F103C8T6 (known as bluepill) programming. I am not using HAL as I am learing to read the datasheets in order to improve my understanding about registers and working with them.
What I have done so far:
1. [BME280_SPI_OUTPUT_UART](https://github.com/upmalisgirts/Bluepill/tree/master/BME280_SPI_OUTPUT_UART) - configuration of GPIOs, USART basic transmission, communication with BME280 via SPI.
